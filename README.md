# killed-in-gaza

## ABOUT THE PROJECT:
This repo provides list of 14k+ names of people killed in Gaza since Oct 7, 2023.
`output/result.csv` as a list of names in arabic and english along with sex and age of the dead.

## HOW IT WORKS:
* Arabic name `name_ar_raw` in `raw.csv` is cleaned using `dict_ar_ar` that mostly removes spaces where it is a single name but is broken down. e.g. (عبد الله,عبدالله).
* Then arabic names in the cleaned `name_ar_raw` are splitted based on spaces and translated into english using `dict_ar_en.csv` file and then joined back as a new column `name_en`.
* Lastly the output is saved in `output/result.csv`

## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE:
To make it easy to contribute, the above process is automated using Github Actions. 
* On every PR, the script is run to check if changes are okay and script is successful.
* On every merge to main, the script is run and `result.csv` is committed to the `output.csv` file.

So there are multiple ways you can contribute:
* if you have new data records, please add them in `raw.csv`, trying to fill in as many columns as possible.
* if you think arabic name needs cleaning, please add it to `dict_ar_ar.csv`.
* if you think arabic to english translation is wrong or if you have want to fill in new arabic to english translation, please add it `dict_ar_en.csv`.

NOTES:
* please ensure you avoid duplicates.
* please check previous data and if english translation of a similar word exist, please use the same letter combination.


Thanks and lets pray to be on the right side of the history and in the hereafter.
